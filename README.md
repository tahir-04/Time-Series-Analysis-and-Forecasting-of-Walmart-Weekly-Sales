🛒 Walmart Weekly Sales Forecasting Using Time Series and Machine Learning Models
📌 Project Overview

Accurate sales forecasting is a critical requirement for large-scale retail organizations to ensure efficient inventory management, demand planning, workforce allocation, and supply chain optimization. This project focuses on forecasting weekly sales of Walmart stores using historical time-series data and a combination of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models.

The dataset reflects real-world retail behavior, incorporating seasonality, holiday effects, and economic indicators, making it suitable for building and evaluating robust forecasting solutions. The goal of this project is to analyze historical trends, build predictive models, compare their performance, and identify the most effective approach for weekly sales forecasting.

🎯 Objectives

Perform time series analysis on Walmart weekly sales data

Capture trend, seasonality, and holiday effects

Implement and compare multiple forecasting models

Evaluate model performance using standard error metrics

Visualize forecasts and interpret results for business insights

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of historical weekly sales data from Walmart stores, including:

Store-level weekly sales figures

Date information for time-series indexing

Holiday indicators affecting sales patterns

Additional economic or contextual features (if applicable)

This dataset is widely used in retail analytics due to its realistic representation of business-driven time-series data.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Frameworks:

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Statsmodels

Prophet

Scikit-learn

TensorFlow / Keras

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Methodology
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Data cleaning and handling missing values

Date-time conversion and indexing

Aggregation of weekly sales

Feature selection and transformation

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Trend analysis of weekly sales

Seasonal pattern identification

Holiday impact analysis

Visualization of time-series components

3️⃣ Model Implementation

The following forecasting models were implemented and compared:

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)

Prophet (Facebook Prophet for additive time-series modeling)

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network)

Each model was trained using historical data and tested on unseen periods to evaluate forecasting accuracy.

4️⃣ Model Evaluation

Models were evaluated using standard forecasting metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

📊 Results & Insights

Classical time-series models effectively captured linear trends and seasonality.

Prophet demonstrated strong performance in handling holiday effects.

LSTM captured complex non-linear patterns in sales behavior.

Model comparison highlighted trade-offs between interpretability and predictive power.

The results show that hybrid evaluation of statistical and deep learning models provides deeper insights into retail sales forecasting.

📈 Visualizations
